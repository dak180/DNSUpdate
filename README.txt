DNSUpdate is a client for the DNS hosting service provided by DynDNS.org and
other similar services.

DNSUpdate is not maintained anymore but the sources are available as-is. If you
want to contribute some fix, feel free to do so by using github. See:

    https://github.com/jonasf73/DNSUpdate

DNSUpdate should be working OK on SnowLeopard yet its code base is pretty old
now.

TODO

- dnsupdate daemon automatic install/update is based on DNSUpdate marketing
  version. This is not very robust and could be improved. More generally the
  daemon installation could be dramatically improved. Adding better ways to
  debug and test development versions could also be a good thing.

[Feel free to add new ideas]
